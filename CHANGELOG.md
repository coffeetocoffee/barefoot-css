# Changelog

All notable changes to Barefoot CSS are documented here. The format is
based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and
this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.0] — 2026-08-12

First public release to npm as **`barefoot-css`** (the bare name `barefoot`
was taken on npm by an unrelated project).

### Added

- Core: cascade-layer architecture (`@layer reset, tokens, base, components,
  utilities`), custom reset, `--fz-*` token system with `light-dark()`
  pairs and `@property`-registered variables.
- Theme presets `auto` / `light` / `dark` / `contrast` via `data-theme`;
  starter themes `editorial`, `dashboard`, `playful` + `custom` template.
- 14 components (buttons, forms, dialog, popover, dropdown, accordion,
  carousel, table, code, card, badge, tabs, grid, view-transition).
- Container-query `[data-grid]` responsive variants and container-unit
  (`60cqi`) carousel slides.
- Anchored popovers (`position-area`) and `view-transition` theme crossfades.
- Opt-in JS modules (zero deps): WAI-ARIA tabs (`js/tabs.js`), reliable
  Esc-close for `details[data-menu]` (`js/details-close.js`), popover-menu
  keyboard nav (`js/popover-menu.js`), all three in `js/barefoot.js`.
- Docs site and conformance demo, deployed to GitHub Pages.

### Fixed

- Dark-mode button hover contrast (1.25:1 → passing) surfaced by the
  axe-core suite; demo `<main>` landmark and `role="group"` form issues.
- Serve bug: no directory→`index.html` mapping made `/demo/` 404.
- Dialog entrance fallback for engines without `transition-behavior: allow-discrete`.

### CI / engineering

- Playwright + `@axe-core/playwright` suite: zero axe violations across
  four page states; keyboard-contract tests; cross-engine behavior runs
  (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit); visual regression with committed baselines.
- Bundled demo webfonts (Inter + JetBrains Mono, OFL) so visual baselines
  are machine-independent.
- Size budget: `index.css` 1.28KB gzipped (limit 10KB), enforced in the
  build and a standalone `npm run size` check.
- Release workflow: tag `v*` → build + budget + tests → `npm publish`
  → GitHub Release.
